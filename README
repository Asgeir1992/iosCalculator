== The Setup === 

I used expo because I had a small propblem with displaying the app in the browser and on my ios simulator therefor I used expo.

although the app is created with expo there is no features used with expo. so the project is pretty much a react-native project. 

I installed expo with the command: npm install --global expo-cli

I created a blank react-native-app with expo.
with the command: expo init iosCalculat

to start the expo project run the command: expo start
then the metro builder should open in your web browser of choice.

to open the ios simulator, press "i" in the terminal where the app is running aftur starting the app.

== Problem with Git ==

I couldn't push the whole project into Git repo because of too many files so I skipped node_modules folder. the solution that worked for me was if I deleted the folder I could set it up again running the command: npm install

it installs all the dependecies needed to open the project.

== other ===

I didn't use any packages, I only used react-native and react to program the calculator so should be open the project. I tried to program the calculator. I have experience with typescript but I decided to skip it this time.

This was a very fun project and I thank you for the opportunity, I had to take some days off from the prject because of work but I tried to finish the project.
